# Loan_Default_Sales_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan defaults using a dataset containing borrower details, loan attributes, and repayment status. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to loan defaults and build predictive models to assist financial institutions in risk assessment.

# Key Insights from the Analysis
Borrower Demographics: Age, employment status, and income influence loan repayment.
Loan Characteristics: Higher loan amounts and longer repayment terms show a higher risk of default.
Credit History: Borrowers with a poor credit score or late payments have a significantly higher default rate.
Marital & Employment Status: Married individuals and those with stable jobs tend to have lower default rates.

# Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data processing, visualization, and machine learning.
Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and model building.

# Dataset
The dataset contains borrower information, including age, income, employment status, loan amount, interest rate, repayment history, and default status.
